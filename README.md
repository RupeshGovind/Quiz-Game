# Quiz-game
- _________________________________________________________Project<br>__________________________________________________________________________
This Python script is a simple quiz game where users are presented with multiple-choice questions and prompted to select the correct answers. 
The script uses a dictionary to store the questions as keys and their corresponding correct answers as values.

Users can choose options using both uppercase and lowercase letters. 
The run_quiz function iterates through each question in the provided dictionary, displays the question to the user, prompts them to input their answer, and then compares their answer to the correct answer stored in the dictionary.

If the user's answer matches the correct answer (ignoring case sensitivity), the script displays "Correct!" and increments the user's score. Otherwise, it displays "Incorrect!".

After all questions have been answered, the script prints the user's final score out of the total number of questions.

The script includes an example set of questions and answers in the quiz_questions dictionary. Users can customize this dictionary with their own questions and answers to create their own quizzes.
